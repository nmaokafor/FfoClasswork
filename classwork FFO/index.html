			<h1>Native Jollof Rice</h1>
			<img src="http://www.africanfoodmap.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ghana_jollofrice.jpg">
			<p>There’s something mind-blowing about this rich, palm oil-flavored recipe that makes it one of the tastiest ways to prepare jollof rice. Also known as Iwuk Edesi by the Effik people of South Eastern Nigeria, it is made with smoked fish and seasoned with crayfish. I especially love how Sisi Yemmie reproduced this recipe with bits of kpomo (cow skin) and smoked prawns to top it off.<br><br>
